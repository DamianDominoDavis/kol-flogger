# Flogger

*You might not be a winner at everything, you might not be a loser at everything; but you won't find out what you're good at if they tell you you're good at everything.*

**Flogger** for <a href="https://github.com/kolmafia/kolmafia">Kolmafia</a> examines your recent pvp fights and adds recent win rate columns to the Information Booth. Cached fights load instantly from /data, and then Flogger processes up to 200~500 new fights per minute. (The cache will save, even if you cancel early from Kolmafia with Escape.)

Try it out! `svn checkout https://github.com/DamianDominoDavis/kol-flogger/trunk/release/`

Now with colorblind modes! Try CLI `flogger help`
