# Flogger

*You might not be a winner at everything,
you might not be a loser at everything;
but you won't find out what you're good at
if they tell you you're good at everything.*

**Flogger** for <a href="https://github.com/kolmafia/kolmafia">Kolmafia</a> examines your recent pvp fights and adds recent win rate columns to the Information Booth. Caches fights to Kolmafia's /data folder, so it can take a minute the first time it runs. Progress will still save if you need to cancel early with Escape.

Try it out! `svn checkout https://github.com/DamianDominoDavis/kol-flogger/trunk/release/`

Now with colorblind modes! Try CLI `flogger help`
