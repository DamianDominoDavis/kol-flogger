# Flogger

"You know, what's this shit, standing around watching the game?<br/>
Get in there, put a helmet on and hurt somebody for Chrissakes, will you?<br/>
**You're not getting paid to watch!**"<br/>
– George Carlin, "Sports", *Playin' with Your Head*, 1986

__***Flogger***__ is a relay script for <a href="https://github.com/kolmafia/kolmafia">KoLmafia</a> which shows PvP win rate and stance frequency statistics. (Afterwards, it's faster; but running this script for the first time can take up to one minute.)

Try it out: `git checkout DamianDominoDavis/kol-flogger`

##### CLI Settings:
- `flogger help` — print these messages
- `flogger history` — adjust for how many most recent fights to show stats
- `flogger purge` — empty the cache and prepare to rescan
- `flogger backup` — copy cache to a backup safe from `purge`
- `flogger recolor` — change colorblind modes

##### Roadmap:
1. Requested: track loot gained, loot lost 
2. add name/ID filter box to archive page
